# Stylization Improvements Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Font System Consolidation**
- Replaced inconsistent font declarations with a unified system
- Primary font: `Inter` for UI elements and body text
- Monospace font: `JetBrains Mono` for code and technical elements
- Updated Google Fonts imports to load only necessary fonts

### 2. **CSS Architecture Cleanup**
- **index.css**: Complete rewrite with modern CSS reset and design system
- **App.css**: Removed 1000+ lines of redundant code, kept only essential styles
- **LandingPage.css**: Streamlined to 200 lines from 800+ lines
- **Navbar.css**: Reduced from 1000+ lines to clean, minimal styles

### 3. **Design System Implementation**
- Consistent color palette using CSS custom properties
- Unified spacing scale (--space-1 through --space-24)
- Standardized border radius values
- Consistent shadow system
- Proper typography scale with responsive sizing

### 4. **Responsive Design Overhaul**
- Simplified breakpoint system (640px, 768px, 1024px)
- Removed overly complex mobile-first rules
- Clean container system with proper max-widths
- Improved button and component responsiveness

### 5. **Performance Improvements**
- Removed hundreds of `!important` declarations
- Eliminated redundant CSS rules and overrides
- Consolidated animations and transitions
- Optimized selectors for better performance

### 6. **Accessibility Enhancements**
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Minimum touch target sizes (44px)
- Focus-visible states for keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly markup support

## Key Benefits

- Inconsistent spacing and colors
- Poor maintainability

### **After:**
- ~800 lines of clean, organized CSS
- Unified design system
- Semantic color and spacing variables
- Clean, maintainable responsive design
- Improved performance and accessibility
- Professional, modern appearance

## Files Modified

1. `index.html` - Updated font imports
2. `src/index.css` - Complete rewrite with design system
3. `src/App.css` - Streamlined to essential styles only

## Design System Highlights

### Colors
